# Learning Swift, 2nd Edition


<img src="http://akamaicovers.oreilly.com/images/0636920053989/lrg.jpg" alt="Learning Swift cover" width="100px;" align="right">

This repo contains the code for [Secret Lab](http://www.secretlab.com.au)'s book, *Learning Swift, 2nd Edition*. 

In *Learning Swift, 2nd Edition*, you create a family of apps, which all work together to let the user create documents with attachments. This repo contains the source code used in the book for all three of the apps - the OS X app, the iOS app and the watchOS app - as well as the playground that contains the general explanation of Swift that appears in Part 1 of the book.

You can buy *Learning Swift* at these fine purveyors of books:

* [O'Reilly Media](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920053989.do?sortby=bestSellers) (direct from the publisher!)
* [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Swift-Building-Apps-iOS/dp/1491967064/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1475029955&sr=8-1&keywords=learning+swift+3)

## How to use this repo

If you're reading *Learning Swift, 2nd Edition*, you can use this repo to check your own code against what we made. If you just want to play with some code, 

**Please note:** this repo contains the *final* version of the app. We deliberately designed the app so that you spend more time *adding* code than you do *replacing* code, which means that if you browse the code in this repo, you'll probably see more code than you've written so far.

### Snippet tags

Throughout the code in this repo, you'll see little tags like this:

	// BEGIN tuples
	let aTuple = (1, "Yes")
	// END tuples

These `BEGIN` and `END` markers are used during the production of the book to include snippets of code into the final book. This ensures that the code that appears in the book is identical to what's in the repo (at least, what was in the repo when the book went to print.)

You can safely ignore the snippet tags - they don't do anything to the code. However, if you're interested in our snippet system, it's [available on GitHub](https://github.com/thesecretlab/snippet-expander).

## Feedback

We hope that you find this repo useful. If you have issues, please either [open an issue](https://github.com/thesecretlab/LearningSwift2Ed/issues/new), or [send us an email](mailto:learningswift@secretlab.com.au).

Unfortunately, we aren't taking contributions for this repo, because it was designed as a partner for a printed book, so accepting changes would likely throw it out of sync with the dead-tree version, leading to confused readers. However, you're strongly encouraged to [fork the code](https://github.com/thesecretlab/LearningSwift2Ed/fork), and make your own, even better version!
